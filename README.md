# Stack-Header-File-for-C
This header file requires stdio.h & stdlib.h header files to be present in your compiler to work properly. 
This header file can perform 8 Stack Operations: 
Creating a Stack {struct S CreateStack(int Capacity);}, 
Query of Capacity of the Stack {int Capacity(struct S Stack);}, 
Status of the Stack {void Status(struct S Stack);}, 
Push {struct S Push(struct S Stack);}, 
Pop {struct S Pop(struct S Stack);}, 
Peek of the Stack {void Peek(struct S Stack);}, 
Displaying all the elements of the Stack {void Display(struct S Stack);}, 
Flushing all the elements of the Stack {struct S Flush(struct S Stack);}.
Thank you for using it ðŸ˜Š.
